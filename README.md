### New Discussion Material
- New discussions are now being hosted on the shrota-dev repository. Outlining of shrota-dev proposals now happens in discussion.
  - Outline: `carbon-gcp-firebase`
    - stackdriver trace `carbon-gcp-firebase`
      - `carbon-gcp-firebase-minimal` -> `carbon-trace-minimal`
      - `stackdriver-read-carbon-trace`
          - sends trace to GCP -> Project -> Operations -> Trace
    - GCP Error Reporting
      - Interpret results from GCP Trace and generate error reports
    - GCP SQL
      - GCP Error Reporting fills SQL tables along with other results from `stackdriver-read-carbon-trace`
      - GCP Buckets store archived SQL data to keep SQL tables clean and small in size 
  - Eeshvar Das, Carbon Project Contributor 
    - started November 2022
    - small efforts of energy spend allocated for consistent Carbon Project Contributions 
  - shrota-dev advances with new clearly defined project roadmap with room for project changes
