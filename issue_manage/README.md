# issue_manage
Issue managing third party contribution.
Created while commenting on a Carbon GitHub issue.
https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/2251
## Third Party Compliance
Contributions may go into the third party folder 
of the Carbon GitHub repository when 
the contribution does not meet contribution requirements.
### Carbon Contribution Requirements Goal
The goal is to meet Carbon contributor requirements.
There's currently no place in Carbon for an issue management package.
Pull request 2410 is currently active and under multiple revisions.
This 2410 is labeled as a `good first issue` and can be used as 
a standard to use in creating this `issue_manage` contribution.

## Package Management Third Party Tool
Carbon does allow for a third party package management tool.
This `issue_manage` tool may serve as a starting point for a
package management tool.
## Code From Carbon Issue 2251
A frequent contributor used this C++ code as an example.
This C++ code may be translated into Carbon
and modified to work as the foundation for `issue_manage`.
```
switch (count % 8)
    case 0: do { *p = *q++;
    case 7:      *p = *q++;
    case 6:      *p = *q++;
    case 5:      *p = *q++;
    case 4:      *p = *q++;
    case 3:      *p = *q++;
    case 2:      *p = *q++;
    case 1:      *p = *q++;
            } while (--n > 0);
```
## Designed for New Contributors
New contributors are not able to quickly and effectively
understand how changes to Carbon
relate to all of the Carbon design topics.
New contributors may find `issue_manage` contribution useful
for learning the design styles when
trying to make pull requests that
comply with Carbon design.
New contributors don't have access to
modifying or manipulating
the GitHub issues tree.
`issue_manage` may allow new contributors 
a chance to familiarize themselves with
the range of concerns that the leads have.
## Not Meant to Manage the Whole Carbon Project
Issues that a new contributor are
interested in working on sometimes
appear to be loaded with
information from many other
important parts of the
Carbon issue and pull request stream.
A small topic tree can be created using this
`issue_manage` contribution.
The topic tree can remain small.
The point is to provide the new contributor
with help in making sure they
include and complete everything noteworthy
in their pull requests.
## Possible Usage for Leads
Leads of the Carbon project may potentially
be able to use `issue_manage` contribution to
manage issues that are
assigned to new contributors.
## Possible Usage as a Runtime Error Handler
The concept behind issue_manage is that
new contributors should start contributing successfully,
without completely knowing or following properly
the design and style requirements
for contribution.
## Recursive Importance of issue_manage
If recursion is defined as a small problem,
within a larger problem; and that small problem
having the same constituents,
of the larger problem;
and that smaller problem is solved repeatedly,
with small and incremental differences; then,
the theory is that issue_manage will help
as an important contribution 
increasing Carbon project successes.
Like Carbon, issue_manage is an experiment,
within the experimental Carbon development.
## Getting Familiar with Carbon
Development of issue_manage, is 
an exercise for a new contributors to,
get familiar with contributing to Carbon development.
## Creating issue_manage
New contributors may possibly not have used Carbon previously.
Creating the `issue_manage` contribution is an exercise in
getting familiar with coding in Carbon language.
This `issue_manage` contribution can be created by:
- Maintaining file format compliance with carbon-lang
  - Change md files to match Carbon md style
    - New contributors like myself, may be excited to contribute to this amazing new technology. It can be tempting to get right in and start writing code or updating docs without reading and entirely understanding contribution requirements. My hope is that other new contributors can follow along with the progress of this `issue_manage` contribution and stay encouraged to maintain healthy contributions to this new Carbon language. The design behind Carbon exceeds all other current emerging language solutions. It is important to keep in mind the strict requirements that the microprocessor has upon Carbon. In order to follow in the footsteps of C++, and recent language evolutions like Rust, Go, Java, and Kotlin, every line of code, and every sentence in the documentation needs to be as accurate as possible. Let's try to do what we can to help Carbon succeed.
- Installing Carbon
  - install carbon onto a GCP Compute Debian vm
- Writing the `issue_manage` tool using Carbon language
  - Simple Carbon basics
  - Issue management code 
    - Simple keyword organizing according to stlyle headers and contributuon requirement headings.
- Read contribution requirements
  - Clone contribution requirement doc headers for quick study
- Stay up to date with Carbon issues and `good first issues`.
  - When feeling confident to have timely completion of a `good first issue`, request permission to contribute.
