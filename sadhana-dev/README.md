## Productivity Free From Desire, Fear and Anger
_vigatecchā-bhaya-krodho । sparshān kritvā bahir bāhyām_ । 
Having put the mind into Sankhya Yoga and Dhyana Yoga meditation,
fears and angers originating from material desirs are mitigated.
With _adhibautika_ awareness,
we may work in _karma-mishra-bhakti-yoga_ with consistent health,
steady productivity,
and ultimate goal of _moksha_ constantly within view.
